# 0x0B. Unity - VR Room

For this project, I created a sitting / standing VR experience in the form of an “escape room”-style game.

## Solution for first room

In order to open the door you must interact with the knight and the rope. Simply interact with these two items by grabbing them. Once each item is touched door will open when player is close.

## Solution for second room

In order for the projector to turn on, the player must find 4 missing chess pieces (rook, knight, bishop, pawn) and return them to the chess board. Once all missing pieces are returned to the board you may now touch the projector with your hands to turn it on.
